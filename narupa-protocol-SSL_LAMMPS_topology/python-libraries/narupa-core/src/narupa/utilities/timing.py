# In Narupa, the `time.sleep` function is consistently invoked between
# successive transmissions in a gRPC data stream to regulate the data transfer
# frequency. However, on Windows systems, the `time.sleep` function commonly
# fails to provide reliable delays, particularly for shorter intervals. To
# address this issue, a more dependable, low-level sleep function is employed.
# This solution will become less critical in the future once an application
# scheduler has been implemented.
