Module providing a server for Extremely Simple Service Discovery (ESSD).

Narupa servers can use this class to broadcast themselves on a local area network, using UDP.

Example
=======

>>> discovery_server = DiscoveryServer(broadcast_port=54545)
>>> # assume one has created a multiplayer server.
>>> hub = ServiceHub(name="Example Narupa Service Hub", address="[::]")
>>> hub.add_service("multiplayer", 54323)
>>> discovery_server.close()
