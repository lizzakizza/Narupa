To profile the lammpshoook we have to account for the fact that we are using the lammps python interpreter.


inside the hooks __init__
yappi.start()
should be added as early as possible

later inside the self.frame loop of the main lammps_hook class the following should be addeed
'''
func_stats = yappi.get_func_stats()

if not hasattr(sys, 'argv'):
    sys.argv = ['']

try:
    func_stats.save('callgrind.out', 'CALLGRIND')
except Exception as e:
    logging.info("exception in printing %s", e)

yappi.clear_stats()
logging.info("saved profiling data")
'''

this saves the profiling data in a callgrind format. For cleaner reports consider commenting out the try_or_except
wrapping decorator
