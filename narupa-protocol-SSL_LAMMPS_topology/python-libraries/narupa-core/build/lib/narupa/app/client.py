class NarupaImdClient:
    """
    Interactive molecular dynamics client that receives frames, create selections,
    and join the multiplayer shared state.

    :param trajectory_address: Address and port of the trajectory service.
    :param imd_address: Address and port of the iMD service.
    :param multiplayer_address: Address and port of the multiplayer service.
    :param max_frames: Maximum number of frames to store in a buffer, if not storing all frames.

    All addresses are optional, so one can, for example, just connect to a trajectory service to passively receive
    frames.

    The :fun:`NarupaImdClient.autoconnect` and :fun:`NarupaImdClient.connect_to_single_server` methods provide
    shorthands for common server setups.

    Inspecting a Frame
    ==================

    The Narupa Imd client can be used to inspect frames received from a :class:`narupa.trajectory.FrameServer`,
    which can be useful for analysis.

    .. python
        # Assuming there is only one server (or set of servers) running.
        client = NarupaImdClient.autoconnect()
        # Request to receive the frames from the server
        client.subscribe_to_frames()
        # Fetch the first frame.
        first_frame = client.wait_until_first_frame(check_interval=0.5, timeout=10)
        # Print the number of particles in the frame
        print(first_frame.particle_count)

    Creating Selections for Rendering
    =================================

    One of the main uses of the client is to create selections that control how a group of particles
    will be visualised and interacted with in other clients (e.g., the VR client):

    .. code-block::  python

        # Connect to the multiplayer
        client.subscribe_multiplayer()
        # Create a selection called 'Selection' which selects particles with indices 0-4
        selection = client.create_selection("Selection", [0, 1, 2, 3, 4])

    Selections are created and updated based on lists of particle indices. Tools such as
    `MDAnalysis <https://www.mdanalysis.org/>`_ or `MDTraj <http://mdtraj.org/>_` are very good at
    extracting indices of particles based on a human readable command.

    With a selection in hand, the way in which it is rendered and interacted with can be changed and
    transmitted to other clients (i.e. VR) using the `modify` context:

    .. code-block::  python

        # Change how the selection is rendered and interacted with.
        with selection.modify():
            selection.renderer = {
                    'color': 'IndianRed',
                    'scale': 0.1,
                    'render': 'liquorice'
                }
            selection.velocity_reset = True  # Reset the velocities after interacting.
            selection.interaction_method = 'group'  # Interact with the selection as a group.
