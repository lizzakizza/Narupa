    "# Run an OpenMM simulation with Narupa\n",
    "\n",
    "Narupa can run OpenMM simulations in two ways: either using [ASE as an interface](../ase/openmm_nanotube.ipynb), or directly using OpenMM mechanisms. Using the ASE interface offers the most flexibility to customise a workflow; in the [graphene example](..ase/openmm_graphene.ipynb) we control the physics parameter of a running simulation from a jupyter notebook. The ASE interface misses some specific OpenMM feature, though; the most noticeable one being holonomic constraints. Using the OpenMM mechanisms without ASE as an interface gives access to all of OpenMM features, but may require more work for some customisation needs. Here, we demonstrate how to to use the OpenMM mechanisms."

The simulation is a normal OpenMM simulation that you can prepare how you would normally do. The only constraint is to include the Narupa custom force.
