# Narupa 2 Protocol

Repository containing the gRPC protocol and python based implementations
of servers for Narupa 2, providing a framework for developing interactive molecular dynamics simulations.

It is designed to be used with Narupa VR clients, e.g. [Narupa IMD](https://gitlab.com/intangiblerealities/narupa-applications/narupa-imd).

This repository is maintained by the Intangible Realities Laboratory, University Of Bristol,
and distributed under [GPLv3](LICENSE).
See [the list of contributors](CONTRIBUTORS.md) for the individual authors of the project.

**The Narupa iMD VR front-end can be found
[on its own repository](https://gitlab.com/intangiblerealities/narupa-applications/narupa-imd).**

## Getting Started

### Quick Start

`narupa.ase` provides a command line interface for running OpenMM simulations. For example, from the `narupa-protocol` directory:

    narupa-omm-ase examples/ase/openmm_files/nanotube.xml


To ensure the integrity and privacy of data when interacting with a remote server, it is vital to establish a secure gRPC connection between the Narupa client and its server.
This involves implementing a process of mutual authentication between the client and server, and encryption of all data in transit.
For a detailed walkthrough of the steps necessary to achieve this secure connection, please refer to our [guide on securing a connection](examples/fundamentals/secure_connection.md).

### Tutorials

The [examples](examples) folder contains [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) for getting started with Narupa. They
are organised into the following folders:

* [ase](examples/ase) - Get up and running with interactive simulations with ASE and OpenMM.
   - [Basic Example](examples/ase/basic_example.ipynb) - Toy example of an interactive simulation.
   - [Nanotube](examples/ase/openmm_nanotube.ipynb) - Set up an interactive nanotube simulation with OpenMM.
   - [Neuraminidase](examples/ase/openmm_neuraminidase.ipynb) - Set up a ligand-protein binding simulation with OpenMM,
   and experiment with Narupa visualizations.
   - [Graphene](examples/ase/openmm_graphene.ipynb) - Set up a graphene simulation with physics parameters
   that can be adjusted on the fly.
* [mdanalysis](examples/mdanalysis) - Visualize static structures and trajectories with MDAnalysis and Narupa.
    - [Structure](examples/mdanalysis/mdanalysis_lsd.ipynb) - Visualize LSD bound to a receptor in Narupa.
    - [Trajectory](examples/mdanalysis/mdanalysis_trajectory.ipynb) - Build your own trajectory viewer with MDAnalysis
    and Narupa.
* [fundamentals](examples/fundamentals) - Understand how Narupa works, so you can create your own applications.
    - [Frame](examples/fundamentals/frame.ipynb) - How Narupa communicates frames of molecular simulations.
    - [Servers](examples/fundamentals/servers.ipynb) - Setting up a Narupa server.
    - [State & Commands](examples/fundamentals/commands_and_state.ipynb) - Synchronizing state between clients and calling commands on the server.
    - [Selections & Visualisation](examples/fundamentals/visualisations.ipynb) - Selecting atoms and setting how to render them.

The tutorials use Jupyter notebooks, [NGLView](https://github.com/arose/nglview) for visualising trajectories, and while not strictly necessary,
assumes you have the [Narupa IMD VR](https://gitlab.com/intangiblerealities/narupa-applications/narupa-imd)
application installed. These can all be installed with conda:

```bash
conda activate narupa
conda install jupyter
conda install nglview
# On Windows only:
conda install -c irl narupa-imd
```

To run the notebooks, download the repository and run jupyter (with [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed):
```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/intangiblerealities/narupa-protocol.git
cd narupa-protocol
conda activate narupa
jupyter notebook
```


### Exploring the code  

The `protocol` folder contains the definitions of the gRPC services.

The `python-libraries` folder contains the library to write Narupa clients and
servers in python, as well as the services implemented in python. The
`python-libraries/prototypes` directory contains examples and (sometimes
unmaintained) prototypes using the python libraries.

The `csharp-libraries/Narupa.Protocol` folder contains C# implementations of clients for receiving trajectories and structures.

## Installation

### Quick installation for a user

* Install Anaconda (avoid Anaconda 2.7 as it is outdated)
* Open the "Anaconda Powershell Prompt" to type the following commands.
* Create a conda environment (here we call the environment "narupa"): `conda create -n narupa "python>3.6"`
* Activate the conda environment: `conda activate narupa`
* Install the Narupa packages: `conda install -c irl -c omnia -c conda-forge narupa-server`

Narupa can interact with the [LAMMPS](https://lammps.sandia.gov/) simulation engine.
If you want to use this specific feature, you need to:

* install LAMMPS with python capabilities
* install mpy4py: `conda install -c conda-forge mpi4py` on Linux and MacOS,
  `python -m pip install mpi4py` on Windows.
* install narupa-lammps: `conda install -c irl -c conda-forge narupa-lammps`.

Developers will want the manual install described below.

### Setup narupa-protocol for developers on Mac and Linux

* Install Anaconda (avoid Anaconda 2.7 as it is outdated)
* Install dotnet
* Clone the narupa-protocol repository
* In a terminal, in the repository root:
    * Create a conda environment (here we call the environment "narupa-dev"): `conda create -n narupa-dev "python>3.6"`
    * Activate the conda environment: `conda activate narupa-dev`
    * Install the required conda package: `conda install -c omnia -c conda-forge openmm MDAnalysis MDAnalysisTests ase mpi4py`
    * Compile the protocol and install the Narupa libraries in your conda environment: `./compile.sh`.  If you do not plan on modifying the python packages, you may run `./compile.sh --no-edit` instead. Otherwise, by default, the narupa packages will be installed in edit mode (`pip install -e`) meaning that changes in the `narupa-protocol` directory will be directly reflected in your python environment.

### Setup narupa-protocol for developers on Windows

* Install Anaconda (avoid Anaconda 2.7 as it is outdated)
* Install the .NET core SDK (see <https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download>)
* Clone the narupa-protocol repository
* In the "Anaconda Powershell Prompt":
    * Create a conda environment (here we call the environment "narupa-dev"): `conda create -n narupa-dev "python>3.6"`
    * Activate the conda environment: `conda activate narupa-dev`
    * Install the required conda packages: `conda install -c omnia -c conda-forge openmm MDAnalysis MDAnalysisTests ase`
    * Compile the protocol and install the Narupa libraries in your conda environment: `./win_compile.ps1`.  If you do not plan on modifying the python packages, run `./win_compile.ps1 -noedit` instead. Otherwise, by default, the narupa packages will be installed in edit mode (`pip install -e`) meaning that changes in the `narupa-protocol` directory will be directly reflected in your python environment.
* The `narupa-lammps` module and its tests require MPI to be installed. Download and install Microsoft MPI from https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/message-passing-interface/microsoft-mpi

## Running the tests

Running the tests is a crucial part of keeping the code base functional. To run the test of the python libraries, run:

    python -m pytest python-libraries

Optionally, you can run most of the tests in parallel with pytest-xdist:

    pytest -m pip install pytest-xdist
    python -m pytest python-libraries -n auto -m 'not serial'
    python -m pytest python-libraries -n0 -m 'serial'

## Running the examples

### ASE IMD Simulations

`narupa.ase` provides a command line interface for running serialised OpenMM simulations. For example, from the `narupa-protocol` directory:

    narupa-omm-ase examples/ase/nanotube.xml

The example files are distributed in the directory
`examples/ase/` from the [git repository](https://gitlab.com/intangiblerealities/narupa-protocol/tree/master/examples/ase).

#### Jupyter Notebooks

The [`python-libraries/narupa-ase/examples`](https://gitlab.com/intangiblerealities/narupa-protocol/tree/master/python-libraries/narupa-ase/examples) examples folder also contains several
Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate visualisation and interaction from a notebook.
The [Narupa ASE documentation](python-libraries/narupa-ase/README.md) provides more details on setting up ASE simulations.

### MD Analysis Trajectories

`narupa.mdanalysis` provides a server for the trajectory service that infinitely loops over the frames of an example
trajectory. To serve the frames on port 54321, from the `narupa-protocol` directory, run

    python ./examples/mdanalysis/example.py

## Troubleshooting

### Autoconnect

If you are having autoconnecting to servers, you can run `narupa-essd-list` to verify which local network servers are visible to your machine.
